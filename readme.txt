THIS PROJECT STARTED AS A ANGULARJS -> NODEJS -> MYSQL INTERACTION PROJECT BUT BECAME MORE OF A CSS PRACTISE PROJECT AFTER THE INITIAL TODO APP WAS COMPLETED
THAT'S WHY THE TODO APP LOGIC WAS REMOVED AND THE CSS PRACTISE WAS LEFT IN THIS PROJECT

BEWARE: THIS PROJECT EXPECTS EXTERNAL RESOURCES TO BE AVAILABLE

NOTE 1: css refresh should also be working 
NOTE 2: after some chrome version there was a bug in the css refresh tool!
